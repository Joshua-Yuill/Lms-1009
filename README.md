# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! What even is this?
So you might be wondering what this repository is about, especially if you found this through idle googling. This repository documents my deep dive into understanding the LMS-1009 Tally Display from 1996 and how it can be used today. I was browsing ebay and found one for sale (for cheap I might add) and I was fasinated on how it could be used, as its 2x 9 charecter display on the front has a real retro feel that I absolutley love.
