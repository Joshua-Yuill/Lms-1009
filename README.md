# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! What even is this?
So you might be wondering what this repository is about, especially if you found this through idle googling. This repository documents my deep dive into understanding the LMS-1009 Tally Display from 1996 and how it can be used today. I was browsing ebay and found one for sale (for cheap I might add) and I was fasinated on how it could be used, as its 2x 9 charecter display on the front has a real retro feel that I absolutley love. 
## Disclaimer:
Seriously electricity is dangerous, and I take ZERO responsibility for anything that happens to you or anything else because of YOUR actions. This whole thing should just be taken as a documentation of how I managed to comunicate with my display and not as a "How-To". Any electrical or other works should only be undertaken by competent persons only.

## âš¡ So without power this is just an advanced rock.
The first task on reciving the unit was figuring out how to power it as mine did not come with a power adapter, and it was not a standard connector that I could easily replace. If yours came with a power adapter, good news, you can skip this section and move onto the next one! For those in the same boat as me, well let me show you how I got round it.

## ðŸ¤”It's electrifying! But what now?
Here comes the most time consuming part of this project. Figuring out just how to comunicate with the unit. From reading around on the limited documentation avalible I was able to understand that the device comunicated over the RS-422/RS-485 protocal. So I did what any sane person would do, I went to amazon and typed in "Usb to RS-422/RS-485 Converter" and was kind of bewildered by the number of diffrent options and variences that are avalible. This could be the part where I pretend like I knew what I was doing, but honestly I picked the one that looked the most versatile and was within my budget and waited for it to arrive.
### How do I do this?
#### Parts list
- Usb to RS-422/RS-485 [I used this one here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DSD-TECH-SH-U11F-Industrial-Application-White/dp/B083XSG1RG)
- RJ 11 Cable [I used this one here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000MSPID4)
(I can't gurentee that any other adapters or cables will or won't work, I just know these do.)
